# final_project_studio_inventory

This project was our final class assignment and was designed by a team of six students, including myself that started as a .NET MVC practice project. We ended up switching the structure from ASP.NET to Node.js due to the flexibility of working with DOM manipulation in Javascript, while still using C# to structure our backend. We saw a malleable single page application as the best way to realize our vision, by separating the content seen by regular users vs. admins. 

This project has two folders, backend and frontend. Open backend folder in Visual Studio, go into Studio-Inventory-API folder then open with Studio-Inventory-API.sln. While running the backend in your browser, open the frontend folder in Visual Studio Code and to run the frontend, in the command line run "npm start" to view in your browser. 

Studio Access Ally is an inventory management system made for any recording studio. Information on inventory is accessible to the average user, and admins of the website can edit that information. There is an inventory request form that users can submit for potential rental of gear that can then be approved or denied by the admins. The list of available equipment dynamically changes based on the approved requests for equipment each day
